# Data transformation with ``dplyr`` 1.0
<img src="pngs/dplyr_guide_for_one_table.png" width=400 height=283 align="right"/>

I have created this alternative cheat sheet (or guide) for those who already know a little about __dplyr__. The point of this cheat is to help you figuring out quickly which verb and arguments to use -- in the context of data transformation applied to a single table of class ``tibble`` or ``data.frame``.

As such the sheet complements and does not substitute the official __dplyr__ cheat sheet which is available [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets).

Note that many __dplyr__ functions are not covered here; all the nice joining functions designed to work with pairs of tables, but also many others.

This cheat sheet about __dplyr__ has been created on the October 18th 2020 using LibreOffice. I tested most thing on __dplyr__ version 1.0.1. The __PDF__ has directly been created using LibreOffice export function, which embeded the typefaces. The __PNG__ has been created importing the __PDF__ in __GIMP__ at a resolution of 200 pixel per inch.

I used the following typefaces:
- Nimbus Sans
- monaco
- Source Code Pro
- Cantarell


## Feedback wanted

If you have any ideas about how to improve this sheet, please file comments as issues or PR.

## Help wanted

Volunters who could turn this into a durable __LaTeX__ file are highly welcome (LibreOffice formating is too fragile for my taste, but the amount of __TikZ__ gymnastic required is a little daunting).
